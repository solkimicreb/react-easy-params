# TodoMVC · [Live Demo](https://solkimicreb.github.io/react-easy-state/examples/todoMVC/dist)

This is a lighter version of the well-known React [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/). It saves the todos in the LocalStorage between page reloads and synchronizes the todos filter with the URL and browser history. You can find the tiny synchronization logic at the bottom of the [store.js file](/store.js).

Be sure to click all the buttons in the demo that you can find.
